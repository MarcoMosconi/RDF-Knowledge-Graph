        "  1) guessing the IRI with simple tricks:\n",
        "     - the album 'Rubber Soul' on DBpedia is `dbr:Rubber_Soul`, and this 'translation' may work for other albums (don't do it manually)\n",
        "     - the album 'Led Zeppelin' on DBpedia is `dbr:Led_Zeppelin_(album)` as the same name is also associated to the band\n",
        "  2) through their `rdfs:label`: for instance, the artist [Amy Winehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Winehouse) has 'Amy Winehouse' as label on DBpedia and therfore after the matching the IRI of the entity can be extracted\n",
        "  3) using the [DBpedia lookup endpoint](https://github.com/dbpedia/lookup). The following request tries to find the DBpedia entity for the artist [Fabrizio De Andrè](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabrizio_De_Andr%C3%A9): https://lookup.dbpedia.org/api/search/KeywordSearch?QueryString=fabrizio%20de%20andre&format=json&MaxHits=5\n",
        "- restrict the search to entities of type 'Album', 'Band', 'Country', etc, in order to avoid overloading DBPedia's endpoint (see [here](http://mappings.dbpedia.org/server/ontology/classes/) for a list of DBPedia classes) and thus avoid high latency or being banned\n",
        "- note that sometimes useful properties to reach entities have the `dbp` prefix which is different from `dbo` ([more info](https://parklize.blogspot.com/2016/05/dbpedia-difference-between-dbo-and-dbp.html)). It's ok to use both\n",
        "- here is a **non-exaustive** list of useful properties: `dbp:hometown`, `dbo:birthPlace`, `dbo:country`, `dbo:formerBandMember`\n",
        "- how to find properties that link two entities of our interest?\n",
        "  1) by checking the [DBpedia ontology](https://akswnc7.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/dstreitmatter/archivo/dbpedia.org/ontology/2023.05.12-020000/ontology_type=parsed.owl) manually\n",
        "  2) by checking the DBpedia ontology with Protégé\n",
        "  3) using the DBpedia resource pages and exploiting your knowledge (or Wikipedia information). For instance, let us consider [Metallica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica), I know that [Dave Mustaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Mustaine) was a member, therefore I ask myself: How are these two entities linked in the DBpedia KG? On the [DBpedia page of Metallica](https://dbpedia.org/page/Metallica) we can find that the property used is `dbo:formerBandMember` thus I can use this property to get band members\n",
        "  4) running SPARQL queries like the following in the DBpedia endpoint:\n",
        "      ```\n",
        "      SELECT DISTINCT ?p\n",
